# Memory game!
_Based on React Starter Kit — "isomorphic" web app boilerplate._

I have some free time, I want to try working a bit with React/Webpack. Being hipster, discover new things. That stuff.

### Getting Started

```shell
$ git clone -o react-starter-kit -b master --single-branch \
      https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit.git MyApp
$ cd MyApp
$ npm install                   # Install Node.js components listed in ./package.json
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```

### How to Build

```shell
$ npm run build                 # or, `npm run build -- release`
```

By default, it builds in a *debug* mode. If you need to build in a release
mode, just add `-- release` flag. This will optimize the output bundle for
production deployment.

### How to Run

```shell
$ npm start                     # or, `npm start -- release`
```

This will start a lightweight development server with "live reload" and
synchronized browsing across multiple devices and browsers.

### How to Deploy

```shell
$ npm run deploy                # or, `npm run deploy -- production`
```

For more information see `tools/deploy.js`.

### How to Update

You can always fetch and merge the recent changes from this repo back into
your own project:

```shell
$ git checkout master
$ git fetch react-starter-kit
$ git merge react-starter-kit/master
$ npm install
```

### How to Test

Run unit tests powered by [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) with the following
[npm](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html) command:

```shell
$ npm test
```

Test any javascript module by creating a `__tests__/` directory where
the file is. Name the test by appending `-test.js` to the js file.
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) will do the rest.

I would have distributed this using my usual [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/). I don't know if I can mix both.
Blah, I'm doing this just for fun anyway.
